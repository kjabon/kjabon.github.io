I'm a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC. I'm deeply interested in applying deep reinforcement learning to challenging problems, like my projects in....
 <ul>
  
  <li>Personal habit <a href='https://www.github.com'>formation</a> (Complete; adding this to github now!)</li>
  <li>Photonic device <a href="https://www.github.com">design</a> (Complete; needs examples)</li>
  <li>Game <a href='https://www.github.com'>development</a> (Theory-crafting and planning complete)</li>
  
</ul> 

I've also...
 <ul>
  <li>Implemented Sampled-MuZero-Reanalyze with sample-efficiency improvements found here, in JAX, in DeepMind's Acme RL framework, synthesizing these implementations. The goal here was my own understanding, and to build it for my own and others' general usage, particularly given its outstanding performance in discrete action spaces. (Full understanding of two source implementations complete; I've just begun to combine them in JAX/Acme.)</li>
  <li>Automated high-volume manufacturing and <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">test</a> of photonic devices with high-precision robotics </li>
  <li>Designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. (If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">device</a> for you.)</li>
</ul> 
^Credit and/or link the people you worked with. Note these should be trimmed down and linked to in the projects section instead.

Can RL be applied to automating these things? Alex Irpan may wisely tell you <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html">not yet</a>. The developers of <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">MuZero</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> may heartily disagree. My optimism forces me to respond with a resounding yes. 

TODO: add blog posts explaining all projects and link to those instead!
