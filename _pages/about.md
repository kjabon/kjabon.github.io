I'm a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC, and I'm deeply interested in applying **deep reinforcement learning** (RL) to challenging problems. <br>If you would like to contact me RE: employment, see links at the bottom.

***

<br>
See my <a href="/projects">projects</a>!

I've applied RL to...
 <ul>
  
  <li>Photonic device <a href="projects/PRL/">design</a></li>
  <li>Personal habit <a href='/projects/coachRL/'>formation</a></li>
  <li>Game <a href='projects/gamerl/'>development</a></li>
  
</ul> 

... and I've implemented <a href="/blog/2023/muzeroAcmeJax/">MuZero</a> with efficiency improvements in Acme.

***

<br><br><br>I've also done the following work, resulting in publications:
 <ul>
  <li>Automated high-volume manufacturing, and <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">test,</a> of photonic devices with high-precision robotics <br>(at <a href="https://www.ipgphotonics.com">IPG</a> and <a href="https://www.analogphotonics.com">AP</a> respectively)</li> 
  <li>Designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">device</a> for you. I was lucky to be advised by <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/milos-popovic/">Milo&scaron; Popovi&#263;</a>.</li>
</ul> 


Can RL be applied to automating these things? Alex Irpan may wisely tell you <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html">not yet</a>. The developers of <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago">AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> may heartily disagree. My optimism forces me to respond with a resounding yes.
