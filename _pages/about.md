Welcome. I'm Kenneth Jabon, a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC. I'm deeply interested in applying deep reinforcement learning to challenging problems, such as photonic device design [link], game development [link], and personal habit formation [link], or [insert your company's project here]. Please get in touch!

I've also automated high-volume manufacturing and test of photonic devices with high-precision robotics, and have designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. (If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a device for you.) Can RL be applied to automating these things? Absolutely.
