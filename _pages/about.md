I'm Ken, a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC. I'm deeply interested in applying deep reinforcement learning to challenging problems, such as photonic device design [link], game development [link], and personal habit formation [link], or [insert your company's project here]. Please get in touch with job opportunities related to this!

I've also automated high-volume manufacturing and test of photonic devices with high-precision robotics, and have designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. (If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a device for you.) See publications for more. Can RL be applied to automating these things? Alex Irpan https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html might tell you no. The developers of ChatGPT [https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/] or MuZero [https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules] may differ.
