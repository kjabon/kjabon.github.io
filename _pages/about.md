I'm a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC. I'm deeply interested in applying deep reinforcement learning to challenging problems, like my projects in....
 <ul>
  
  <li>Personal habit <a href='/blog/2023/distill'>formation</a> (Complete; adding this to github now!)</li>
  <li>Photonic device <a href="/blog/2023/PRL">design</a> (Complete; needs examples)</li>
  <li>Game <a href='/blog/2023/gamedev'>development</a> (Theory-crafting and planning complete)</li>
  
</ul> 

I've also...
 <ul>
  <li>Implemented <a href="/blog/2023/muzeroAcmeJax/">MuZero</a> with efficiency improvements in Acme</li>
  <li>Automated high-volume manufacturing, and <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">test,</a> of photonic devices with high-precision robotics (at <a href="https://www.ipgphotonics.com">IPG</a> and <a href="https://www.analogphotonics.com">AP</a> respectively)</li> 
  <li>Designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">device</a> for you. I was lucky to be advised by <a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/milos-popovic/">Milo&scaron; Popovi&#263;</a>.</li>
</ul>

Can RL be applied to automating these things? Alex Irpan may wisely tell you <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html">not yet</a>. The developers of <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago">AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> may heartily disagree. My optimism forces me to respond with a resounding yes.
