I'm a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC, and I'm deeply interested in applying **deep reinforcement learning** (RL) to challenging problems. <br>If you would like to contact me RE: employment, see links at the bottom.

***


See my [projects](/projects)!

I've applied RL to...
  
- Photonic device [design](/projects/PRL/)
- Personal habit [formation](/projects/coachRL/)
- Game [development](projects/gamerl/)
  

... and I've implemented [MuZero](/blog/2023/muzeroAcmeJax/) with efficiency improvements in Acme.

***

I've also done the following work, resulting in [publications](/publications):

- Automated high-volume manufacturing, and wafer-scale [test](/publications/), of photonic devices with high-precision robotics <br>(at [IPG](https://www.ipgphotonics.com) and [AP](https://www.analogphotonics.com) respectively)
- Designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a [device](https://kjabon.github.io/publications/) for you. I was lucky to be advised by [Milo&scaron; Popovi&#263;](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/milos-popovic/).

Can RL be applied to automating these things? Alex Irpan may wisely tell you [not yet](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html). The developers of [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) or [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) may heartily disagree. I'm optimistic for this technology's future.
