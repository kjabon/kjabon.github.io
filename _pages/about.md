I'm a CS/Photonics guy out of UIUC. I'm deeply interested in applying deep reinforcement learning to challenging problems, like my past projects in...
 <ul>
  <li>Photonic device <a href="https://www.github.com">design</a></li>
  <li>Game <a href='https://www.github.com'>development</a></li>
  <li>Personal habit <a href='https://www.github.com'>formation</a></li>
</ul> 

Don't hesitate to get in touch with job opportunities applying RL!

I've also...
 <ul>
  <li>Automated high-volume manufacturing and <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">test</a> of photonic devices with high-precision robotics </li>
  <li>Designed and taped out microring resonator "molecules" for photon pair generation. (If you're making a linear-optic quantum computer, I have a <a href="https://kjabon.github.io/publications/">development</a> for you.)</li>
</ul> 

TODO: add blog posts explaining all projects and link to those instead!

Can RL be applied to automating these things? Alex Irpan  might tell you <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html">no</a>. <br>The developers of <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">MuZero</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> may disagree. <br>My optimism forces me to respond with a resounding yes!
