## Why habits?

>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit.

-Will Durant, Historian


Stephen King is one of the most prolific writers of our time. How has he managed to write more than 60 novels, and sell more than 400 million copies? The answer is of course, consistent and sustainable effort. As he recounted in *On Writing,* (add a pic) the vast majority of his books weren't the result of 16-hour sprints or all-nighters. He makes it an unbreakable personal rule to write for 4 hours a day, every day, no exceptions. Simple, but powerful.

Everyone can agree that exercise, healthy eating, a consistent sleep schedule, and reading every day are all things we **should** be doing, and probably benefit the rest of our activities indirectly. There's much literature on tricks for forming good habits, like "hacking" cues that trigger certain behaviors. [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/habits) has plenty to say on the subject, and following his advice is a great start.

## I hear you. Counterpoint: Skyrim

Waking up an hour early to get a run in? Gross. It's raining. How about some hot chocolate instead? Now add a fuzzy blanket and some X-Files. Oh yeah. It's all coming together. (Insert Kronk meme here).

If **only** we had someone around to say hey man, I know it's raining outside, and you're not even sure you want to get into this whole cardio thing. But I'm gonna make it worth your while. Go do that run for me, and you can watch as much X-Files as you want.

Ok, sounds pretty good. But what if I'm a good little optimizer, and I want to form as many habits as possible in as short a time as possible, without burning myself out and falling off the wagon of every last thing in an endless loop? And what if I don't want to run every day: I just want to run two days a week, and go to the gym the other two, and maybe do hot yoga the other two? It sucks keeping track of all this stuff every day! And another thing! If I'm being rewarded with endless Skyrim, how am I going to have time for anything beyond exercise and Skyrim?

## Enter: CoachRL

Alright, these complaints are relatable and valid. So let's automate them to oblivion! No more tedium of tracking and decision-making. Just a "**personal coach**" that tells you what to do and gives you a lil treat for doing it.

This project started with a simple spreadsheet and turned into a daily personalized fortune-teller. First I'll go over the features and explain the reasoning behind them. Then I'll go over how to set it up for yourself. I'll describe the "under-the-hood" mechanics of the system in another post. (Hint: it uses reinforcement learning).

**Ingredients**

A Mac/Linux device. (Underlying libraries used do not currently run on Windows. I could, in principle, change this - let me know if you're interested in the comments below).

A device on which you can install the messaging app Telegram; used for notifications and requesting "lil treats" for completing tasks.

*Optional but recommended:* 

A tablet of some form; for a daily to-do list without rewriting your routine every day. I use an iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil 2.

An iPhone; is used for auto-weight tracking. (Currently uses iCloud to transfer things over, but again, this could be changed if interest.)

**Disclaimer**

It is not 100% automated, as that would make it too brittle to be worth setting up for your ever-changing goals. Furthermore, as the current user-base is a grand total of me, the setup is not quite a Apple-certified streamlined experience. If I sense a good amount of interest, there's a good chance I would make things easier for people! Let me know in the comments below, or leave a star on the [Github repo](github.com).

## What that app do?



This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

***

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
  df,
  lat='Latitude',
  lon='Longitude',
  z='Magnitude',
  radius=10,
  center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
  zoom=0,
  mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

***

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
